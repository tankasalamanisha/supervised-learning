## Supervised Learning Techniques

This repo with contain the implimentations of Supervised algorithms and various aspects associated with Machine learning(Applied aspect).

I have been referring to Abhishek Thakur's book : **Approaching almost (any) Machine Learning Algorithm** and Aurelien Geron's book : **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow**. 

I'm looking for two major aspects here:
1. Furthering my knowledge in the field of Machine learning in the applied aspect terms.
2. Getting myself acquaited with the packages and deployment aspect of ML.

Hopefully this repo withh help others as well. please head-over to these two Author's books and give them a shout out.
